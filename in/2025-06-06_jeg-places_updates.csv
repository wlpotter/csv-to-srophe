x	5595		Dalmatius, Monastery of	ܕܝܪܐ ܕܕܠܡܛܝܘ	monastery	The Syrian holy man Isaac erected, in 382, the first monastery in Constantinople. Isaac's successor as superior was Dalmatus or Dalmatius, after whom the monastery was named. Its great importance is reflected by the fact that its superior was an archimandrite, who also acted as supervisor of all other monasteries in Constantinople. The monastery was a bastion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and Joh. Eph., EH 2.9, mentions it as a place of confinement for high-ranking miaphysites in the early 570s.
